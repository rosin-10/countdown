Countdown Timer with Greeting
Project Description
The Countdown Timer with Greeting project is a simple PHP web application that allows a user to input a greeting message and set a countdown timer. The countdown timer displays the time remaining in seconds and expires after the countdown reaches zero. Once the countdown expires, a session alert is shown to the user, and the page reloads.

Greeting Message: The user can input a custom greeting message.
Countdown Timer: The user can set a countdown time (in seconds).
Timer Display: The remaining time is shown in real-time on the webpage.
Session Management: The countdown and greeting message are stored in the session, allowing them to persist across page reloads.
Expiration Alert: When the countdown reaches zero, an alert is triggered, notifying the user that the session has expired, and the page is reloaded.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, JavaScript
Backend: PHP (session handling)
Web Server: XAMPP or similar server setup (for local development)
